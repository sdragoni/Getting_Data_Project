This document describes the tidy dataset generated from the merged datafiles imported 

The original location of these files is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

These files were imported into data frames with names that corresponded to the original file names

There is a full description of this data here

The final dataset was generated by combining the activity and y data frames with the columns from the X dataframes containing the mean and std.

This final dataframe (called all_data) was used to produce the summ_data data frame.  THe only difference between these two data frames is that the summ_data data frame contains the mean of the mean and std by activity and subject. A description of these dataframes is listed below.

The summ_data dataframe was written out to the file summary_file.txt
